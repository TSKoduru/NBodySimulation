# NBodySimulation
This was a side project I did over the summer because I thought making an N-body simulation sounded pretty cool. The three experiments are three different ways I tried to program the sim, but Experiment 3 is when everything really clicked together. Try it out! All you need to do is run the file, and then drag and drop to add new planets. I took the liberty of adding a sun in there so you can mess around with orbits and whatnot. You can hit space to clear the screen and mess around even more!

Hint: There's a way to make a temporarily stable three body system here. Can you figure it out?
